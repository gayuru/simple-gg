## working on

- pgm'ing dashpivot @ sitemate — turning chaos into shipped product
- roadmap triage: tech debt + prod bugs + "pls can we just…" requests
- tighter pde process: clearer priorities, faster decisions, less meeting yak
- ai experiments in real workflows (agentic-ish), starting small then scaling
- hiring/pipeline stuff — incl the women in engineering talent tryout in melb

## reading

- an elegant puzzle
- made to stick
- thinking, fast and slow

## exploring

- better weekly metrics + summaries (so we're not arguing off vibes)
- running/swimming consistency (breathing still negotiable)
